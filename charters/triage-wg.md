# Triage-WG Charter

### Objective:
The Triage-WG is focussed around triaging issues & pull requests on the rust-lang repositories so that we can maintain steady progress on features. This WG allows people to triage without the requirement of being members of the rust release team.
Members will not obtain rust-lang membership from being a part of this WG, but this WG will act as a feeder to the rust-release team.

### How do I join?

-- If you are interested in joining this wg, leave a message in the [#t-release/triage stream on the rust-lang Zulip][z]

### Who can join?

- Anyone interested in this wg and interested in contributing towards the rust community even if they are a beginner or haven't written any code in rust yet.

### What This WG Covers:

- Triaging issues on rust-lang/rust repository
- Triaging pull requests on rust-lang/rust repository
- Diagnosing crater runs and opening issues

### Out of Scope:

- Nominating issues for stable/beta
- Rollups of PRs

### Communication:
Meetings and interactions will be held in [#t-release/triage stream on the rust-lang Zulip][z]. Occasional voice meetings might take place on Zoom.

### Code of Conduct:
All interactions on this repository (whether on issues, PRs, or
elsewhere) are governed by the [Rust Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

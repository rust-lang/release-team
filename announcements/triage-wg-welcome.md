The Release team is pleased to announce the **triage working group**, which will
assume responsibility for triaging issues and pull requests in the
[rust-lang](https://github.com/rust-lang) repositories as well as for
diagnosing failures in Crater runs.

Triaging is a high-impact activity that requires a relatively small time commitment.
The goal is to prevent issues and pull requests from being ignored by the
Rust team or forgotten by the contributors who submit them, and to ensure
that everyone involved in the process knows what the next step is in the process
toward resolving an issue or merging a pull request. In a large project
like Rust, keeping up with community contributions is one of the main
difficulties when scaling up development efforts, so the triage WG's efforts
will alleviate a key pain point in Rust's growth.

Triaging does not require reading or writing code. If you like the Rust project
and would like to help it advance but do not feel comfortable submitting
pull requests, this is the perfect WG to join.

If you're interested in becomoing a triage WG member, please leave a message in
the #triage-wg channel on the [rust-lang
Discord][https://discord.gg/rust-lang]!

For more information, please see [the charter for the new
group](https://github.com/rust-lang/release-team/blob/master/charters/triage-wg.md).

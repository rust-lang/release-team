The Release team is pleased to announce the **triage working group**, which
will assume responsibility for triaging issues and pull requests in the
[rust-lang](https://github.com/rust-lang) repositories as well as for
diagnosing failures in Crater runs.

Triaging is a high-impact activity that requires a relatively small time
commitment.  It also does not require reading or writing code.  The goal of
triage is to prevent issues and pull requests from being ignored by the Rust
team or forgotten by the contributors who submit them, and to ensure that
everyone involved in the process knows what the next step is in the process
toward resolving an issue or merging a pull request. In a large project like
Rust, keeping up with community contributions is one of the main difficulties
when scaling up development efforts, so the triage WG's efforts will alleviate
a key pain point in Rust's growth.

If you're interested in becomoing a triage WG member, please leave a message in
the #triage-wg channel on the [rust-lang
Discord][https://discord.gg/rust-lang]!

For more information, please see [the charter for the new
group](https://github.com/rust-lang/release-team/blob/master/charters/triage-wg.md).
